    "As explained in the [README](http://github.com/indralab/nf_model), there are several steps that are used in the assembly of EMMAA models that currently require direct SQL access to the [INDRA Database](https://db.indra.bio). In particular, initializing and updating EMMAA models requires access to user-submitted curations and raw, unpreprocessed statements from the machine reading systems, neither of which are currently accessible via the public REST API of the INDRA Database (accessible at https://db.indra.bio). During the NF Hackathon we didn't have sufficient time to update EMMAA to run off strictly public APIs but we plan to do so in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, in this notebook we show how we initialize the models for deploying to EMMAA, and we illustrate what EMMAA does on the platform to assemble them and generate causal explanations. These are generally the same steps and functions that are run in the AWS Batch jobs generated by the EMMAA system, but instead of reading/writing results to AWS S3 for visualization in the EMMAA web application we create and explore the results in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the three key parts of our project:\n",
    "1. Assembling an NF Knowledge Network from text mining results stored in the INDRA Database\n",
    "2. Assembling a model of Ras-NF mechanisms from natural language descriptions of mechanisms\n",
    "3. Explaining the causal relations in the text-mined model using the curated model\n",
    "4. Using both models to explain NF drug-screening results"
