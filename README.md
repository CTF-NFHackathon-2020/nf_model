## Abstract

*: Summarize everything in a few sentences.* 

The scientific literature is growing exponentially, making it increasingly
difficult for researchers to monitor new discoveries and identify the ones that
have the potential to explain unresolved questions in their field. This is
especially true for rare diseases like NF, where relevant discoveries may be
come from many subdiscipldescribed in the context of biology with no obvious
connection to NF 

## Introduction *: What's the problem? Why should we solve it?*

The scientific literature is growing exponentially, making it increasingly
difficult for researchers to monitor new discoveries and identify the ones that
have the potential to explain unresolved questions in their field. This is
especially true for rare diseases like NF, where relevant discoveries may be
come from many subdiscipldescribed in the context of biology with no obvious
connection to NF 

## Methods

*: How did we go about solving it?*

## Results

*: What did we observe? Figures are great!*

## Conclusion/Discussion:

### Please make sure you address ALL of the following:

#### *1. What additional data would you like to have*

#### *2. What are the next rational steps?* 

#### *3. What additional tools or pipelines will be needed for those steps?*

#### *4. What skills would additional collaborators ideally have?*

## Reproduction: *How to reproduce the findings!*



### Docker

*The Docker image contains <R/jupyter> notebooks of all analyses and the dependencies to run them. *Be sure to note if you need any special credentials to access data for these analyses, **don't package restricted data** in your containers!*

Instructions for running the following notebooks: *be sure to adjust these instructions as necessary! check out https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/nfhackathon2020/ for example containers and instructions*

1. `docker pull labsyspharm/nf_hack:latest`

2. `docker run -it -p 8880:8880 jupyter notebook --port 8880`

Access the Jupyter notebook server using the link in the output, and navigate
to  TODO
